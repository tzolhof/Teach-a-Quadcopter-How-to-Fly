# Deep RL Quadcopter Controller

Project for the Udacity's Machine Learning Course - Term 2

Teach a Quadcopter How to Fly

This is a Reinforcement Learning project that designs an agent to fly a quadcopter, and then trains it using the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm.

The repository includes:

* the Jupyter Notebook - iPython with all the steps of the project;
* the html version of my work;
* this README file;
* the data.txt file, which contains the data of the simulation made in the beginning of the Notebook;
* the physics_sim.py file, which contains the simulator for the quadcopter;
* the requirements.txt file, which contains the libraries and respective versions used in the project;
* the rewardfunction.jpg file, which contains the graph of the reward function designed for the project;
* the task.py function, which contains the details of the task, including the original and the new designed reward functions for the project;
* the agents folder, containing: 1- the policy_search.py file (provided as example by Udacity) and 2 - the agent.py file, with the implementation of the algorithm mentioned above, as well as noise and replay buffer classes.
